# Titanic EDA â€” Summary (Sample)

This short report summarizes findings from the included sample dataset (10 rows). It is intended as a template.

## Key steps performed
- Data loading and overview
- Missing value check (Age, Cabin contain missing values)
- Simple visualizations: survival counts, age distribution, correlation heatmap
- Notes on feature engineering and modeling suggestions

## Observations (sample)
- The sample contains both survived (1) and non-survived (0) passengers.
- Age column contains missing value(s).
- For a full analysis, perform: detailed missing-value imputation, title extraction from Name, create family-size feature, encode categorical features (Sex, Embarked), and evaluate simple models (Logistic Regression, RandomForest).

## Next steps
- Replace sample CSVs with full dataset (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) from Kaggle for complete EDA.
- Generate a PDF export of this report if required.
